Network Anomoly Detection

This project was inspired by the following paper:
[Anomoly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10769.pdf)

This project takes real network traffic data which is annotated between malicious and not malicious and feeds that data into a bidirectional RNN to achieve an AUC of 0.83 while the paper achieves an AUC of 0.84
